<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with the installation of V2Ray on Ubuntu 22.04, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ubuntu 22.04:</strong> Ensure that you have a clean installation of Ubuntu 22.04 on your server or virtual machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Root Access:</strong> You’ll need root access or a user account with sudo privileges to execute commands and install packages on the Ubuntu system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain (Optional):</strong> While not mandatory, having a domain for your V2Ray server allows you to utilize TLS (Transport Layer Security) for enhanced security. If you choose to use a domain, ensure that it is properly configured and points to your server’s IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloudflare Account:</strong> If you opt to use a domain for your V2Ray server, having a Cloudflare account is recommended. Cloudflare offers additional security features and can help improve the performance and reliability of your server by acting as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) and providing DDoS protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>V2Ray Client:</strong> To connect to the V2Ray server, you’ll need a V2Ray client installed on your device. For Windows, you can use clients like v2rayn or nekoray. For mobile devices, you can use a client like v2rayng.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With these prerequisites fulfilled, you’ll be ready to proceed with the installation of V2Ray on Ubuntu 22.04. If you opt to use a domain and Cloudflare, your V2Ray setup will benefit from enhanced security and performance features.</p>
<h3 id="ssh-access-to-your-server">SSH Access to Your Server</h3>
<p>SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows you to securely access and manage your server remotely. Before you can install V2Ray on your Ubuntu 22.04 server, you’ll need to connect to it via SSH.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-open-terminal-linuxmac-or-putty-windows">Step 1: Open Terminal (Linux/Mac) or PuTTY (Windows)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Linux/Mac Users:</strong> Open the terminal application on your local machine. You can usually find it in your applications menu or by searching for “Terminal.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows Users:</strong> Download and install PuTTY, a popular SSH client for Windows. You can download PuTTY from the official website: <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY Download Page</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-2-connect-to-your-server">Step 2: Connect to Your Server</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linux/Mac Users:</strong> In the terminal, use the following command to connect to your server:</li>
</ul>
<pre class=" language-css"><code class="prism  language-css">ssh username@server_ip
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Replace `username` with your actual username on the server, and `server_ip` with the IP address of your Ubuntu 22.04 server.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Users (PuTTY):</strong> Open PuTTY and enter the IP address of your server in the “Host Name (or IP address)” field. Leave the port as default (22) and click “Open” to start the SSH connection.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-3-enter-your-password">Step 3: Enter Your Password</h4>
<ul>
<li>After initiating the SSH connection, you’ll be prompted to enter your password. Type your password carefully (note: no characters will appear on the screen as you type), then press Enter.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-4-verify-connection">Step 4: Verify Connection</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once you’ve entered the correct password, you should be logged into your Ubuntu 22.04 server via SSH. You’ll see a command line interface, indicating that you now have remote access to your server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully connected to your Ubuntu 22.04 server via SSH. You’re now ready to proceed with the installation of V2Ray. If you encounter any issues during the SSH connection process, double-check your server’s IP address, username, and password.<br>
Certainly, let’s modify the installation process to include prompts for username, password, and port, and let’s choose a custom port for added security:</p>
<h3 id="step-5-install-3x-ui-panel">Step 5: Install 3X-UI Panel</h3>
<p>3X-UI is a user-friendly panel that simplifies server management tasks. To install 3X-UI on your Ubuntu 22.04 server, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu 22.04 server. If you’re accessing your server via SSH, you can use the terminal application on your local machine.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Run the following command to update the package lists for upgrades and new package installations, and then upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions:</p>
<p>bash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y</code></p>
<p>This command ensures that your server has the latest software packages and security updates installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the package update and upgrade process is complete, run the following command to download and execute the installation script for 3X-UI:</p>
<p>bash &lt;(curl -Ls <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhsanaei/3x-ui/master/install.sh">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhsanaei/3x-ui/master/install.sh</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This command will retrieve the installation script from the GitHub repository and execute it. During the installation process, you may encounter a purple window. If you see this, simply press Enter to proceed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Follow the prompts during the installation process. When prompted, provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Username:</strong> Choose a username for accessing the 3X-UI panel.</li>
<li><strong>Password:</strong> Set a strong password for the chosen username.</li>
<li><strong>Port:</strong> Specify a custom port number (e.g., 8443) for accessing the 3X-UI panel. Using a non-standard port enhances security by reducing exposure to common attack vectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the installation is complete, you will receive a confirmation message indicating that 3X-UI has been successfully installed on your server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access 3X-UI by opening a web browser and navigating to the URL of your server followed by the custom port number you specified during installation. For example, if your server’s IP address is “123.456.789.0” and you chose port 8443, you would enter "<strong><a href="https://123.456.789.0:8443">https://123.456.789.0:8443</a>"</strong> in the address bar of your browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log in to the 3X-UI panel using the username and password you configured during the installation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon successful login, you will be greeted with the 3X-UI dashboard, where you can manage various aspects of your server with ease.</p>
</li>
</ul>
